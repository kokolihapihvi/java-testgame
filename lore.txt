	Space thing.



	after drifting in space for 53 years, during a voyage to an mining comission, the ships interplanetary navigation system is faulted.
	this leads into emergency, our voyager needs to evacuate from the failing spaceship, nearby planet will provide resourses from the existing ruins of an abandoned 
	colonizing attempt, the dangers included, are still operational security bots, crumbling buildings, and the othervice hostile enviroment.

	Regardless, the space cadet manages to gather enough parts for a rocket, and a wingman to escape the planet, repairing the space wreck of the spaceship they
	now posess the ability for interstellar travel.

	now the urgent news from the failure of the mission needs to be informed for the mining comission leaders, thus gaining enough energy and resources to reach a civilized 
	enough planet, with functioning communication relays upon this voyage they are attacked by an hostile group of space pirates.

	now there is the change to decide wheter to be good or evil space traveler.

	to give the information regarding the former mission to the pirates, in turn for parts, resources, and an opportunity to join the frigade, or fight gallantly and
	later be rewarded by the s.a.o.a. party.

	either way, the space cadets gain acces to map data pointing out nearest headquarters, and the former, or still existing peers gain information about the current status.
	
	the mining comission, space pirates, s.a.o.a, have existed for millenias fighting over resources and lost technologies, scattered trough the vastness of space.
	On the forgotten planets, lay plenty of treasures to find for daring adventurers.
	
	The old cyber frame may be upgraded with various upgrades, giving advantage upon hostile enviroments and situations, mobility, and perception.
	
	Companions may recieve similiar upgrades depending from the style of play, also their abilities during space fights and mercanary dispositions may vary according to
	what upgrades are in use, menacing looking ally will most likely cause the trader to be either scared or awed by their precence, whilst sharp eyed shooter will provide
	paramount tactical advantages in combat situations, the more crafty companion will surely be of use in upgrading the spaceship, and in the management of faction
	spacestations, whilst companion with high leadership will be able to boost morale in oppressive situations.

	energy harvesting, and selling from build up colonies is one way of earning resources, the other is taking what is to be taken, and third is to protect the massive
	dyson spheres.
